# Welcome on my gitHub page

I am Miriam and i am a Softwaredeveloper with 8 years of experience.

My main focus in development is based in:

- PHP
- Symfony

Right now i am doing a Webdevelopment-Bootcamp at neuefische to expand my knowledge into:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

I am not very creative hence why there are for now only some basics and no fancy shit xD
