## About me

I am Miriam and i am a Softwaredeveloper with 8 years of experience.
My main focus in development is based in:

- PHP
- Symfony

Right now i am doing a Webdevelopment-Bootcamp at neuefische to expand my knowledge in:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Projects

You can find the following Projects on my github:

### [Bootcamp Webchallanges](https://github.com/miriamRichter94/web-challanges)

This contains all Challanges which we had to absolves regarding each learned lesson in the Webdevelopment-Bootcamp.

### [Session Notes](https://github.com/miriamRichter94/session-notebook)

This Contains all Notes from the Sessions out of the Webdevelopment Bootcamp.
But i expanded them idealy for beginners.

I took my own notes, the session handout, and own research and wrote together with Ai those notebooks for each topic.

Currently (11.02.2026) those are still work in progress.

### [Quizz App](https://github.com/miriamRichter94/quizzApp)

The Quizz-Ap is the first minor project we had in the Web-Development Bootcamp.
It only contains HTML and CSS without any JavaScript Functionallity.
You can find the Live deployment here: [Live Deployment](https://miriamrichter94.github.io/quizzApp/)

### [Personal Website](https://github.com/miriamRichter94/personal-website)

The project "Personal Website" is actually also an ongoing project, which started in the WebDevelopment-Bootcamp.

The plan is that I want to combine in this all my created things. Not only show off my skills but also share my knowledge i collected in the session notes.

And later maybe also Shows my gaming side.

### [Fincance Tracker raw](https://github.com/miriamRichter94/finance-tracker-raw)

The "Finance Tracker raw" project is a little project to sharpen my PHP skills. Yes it is very basic and based on my experience it shouldn't be that big of a thing.
BUT i use it to also write and try just raw PHP without any Frameworks.

This Project evolved from saving data into csv-files to save data in an easy SQLite-Database.

Right now the project is executeable via CLI.

Future of the Project:

- Writing a Simple WebApplication for it without anyframework.
- putting it in a framework (mostlikely Symfony)
